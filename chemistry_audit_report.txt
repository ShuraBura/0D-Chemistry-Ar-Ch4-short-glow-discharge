POTENTIALLY MISSING REACTIONS:
================================================================================

1. H + H + M → H2 + M (three-body recombination)
   STATUS: NOT FOUND in define_rates.py
   Rate: k ~ 1e-32 cm^6/s at 300K (McEwan & Phillips 1975)
   Impact: At nH~2e14 cm⁻³, n_total~2e16 cm⁻³:
           Loss rate = k * nH² * M = 1e-32 * (2e14)² * 2e16 = 8e13 cm⁻³/s
           NEGLIGIBLE compared to CH+H loss (6e12 cm⁻³/s)

2. C + C + M → C2 + M (three-body C2 formation)

   Rate: k ~ 1e-33 cm^6/s (estimated)

RATE CONSTANT SOURCES & CONDITIONS:
================================================================================

Baulch et al. (2005) - Gas-phase kinetics database
   - Neutral-neutral reactions
   - Temperature range: 200-3000K
   - OUR CONDITIONS: T~400K - IN RANGE ✓

Morgan (1992) - Electron impact cross sections
   - Electron-impact dissociation/ionization
   - Energy range: 0-20 eV
   - OUR CONDITIONS: Te~1-2eV - IN RANGE ✓

Janev & Reiter (2002) - Recombination rates
   - Dissociative recombination
   - Te range: 0.1-10 eV  
   - OUR CONDITIONS: IN RANGE ✓

================================================================================
CRITICAL FINDINGS:
================================================================================

1. C2 + H → CH + C is THE problem
   - Rate k=9.6e-11 is from Baulch (2005) at 300K
   - Need to verify this rate at YOUR conditions (T~400K)
   - This is for GROUND STATE C2
   - Is your C2 vibrationally excited? That could change the rate!

2. CH + H → C + H2 is main CH loss
   - Rate k=1.2e-10 from Baulch
   - Verified at 300K, should be OK at 400K

3. MISSING: CH + H2 → CH2 + H
   - Could provide additional CH loss
   - Rate k~1e-12 to 1e-11 cm³/s
   - At nH2~1e16 cm⁻³: Loss rate = 1e-11 * 1e9 * 1e16 = 1e14 cm⁻³/s
   - THIS COULD BE IMPORTANT!

4. H_drift_gain represents REAL physics
   - From profile: y0 = 1.84e14 cm⁻³ baseline
   - Estimated H_drift ~ 5.7e16 cm⁻³/s
   - Likely H production at cathode + diffusion

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS:
================================================================================

1. ADD: CH + H2 → CH2 + H
   - Could significantly reduce CH
   - Check literature for rate at 400K

2. VERIFY: C2 + H → CH + C rate constant
   - Check if C2 is vibrationally excited in your plasma
   - Excited C2 could have different reactivity

3. RE-ENABLE: H_drift_gain with value ~5.7e16 cm⁻³/s
   - This represents physical H flux

4. CHECK: H2 density in your model
   - If nH2 is high, CH+H2 reaction could be important

5. MEASURE (if possible): Vibrational temperature of C2
   - This affects C2+H reaction rate
